# SQL Basics - Exercises

This folder contains a series of short exercises that will help you practice the basics of SQL.

## Data Access

Data for these exercises can be found in the [Data](../Data) folder. There are two databases in this folder:

- [wrecks.sqlite](../Data/wrecks.sqlite) - contains data on shipwrecks in Lake Superior.
- [duluth-osm.gpkg](../Data/duluth-osm.gpkg) - created from an extract of OpenStreetMap data from downtown Duluth.
- There is also another version of `duluth-osm` that is in a format (`.db`) that might be easier for some applications to ingest.

These are all variations of SQLite databases.

## Practice Environment

We recommend using [SQLite Online](https://sqliteonline.com/) for these exercises. It is free and awesome. :rocket:

To load a database, go to `File` -> `Open DB` and select the database file you want to load.
