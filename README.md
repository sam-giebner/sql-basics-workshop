# sql-basics-workshop
In this hands-on workshop, we’ll start by learning the basics of SQL and how to set up a SQL development environment. Next, we’ll create queries with complex joins and tame unruly datasets with CASE statements. We’ll end by looking at how to use SQL to access your data in ArcGIS Pro.
